<h2 id="report-of-field-work-completed-and-training-activities-for-the-field-crew">Report of field work completed and training activities for the field crew</h2>
<p>We visited Panama from the second week of January. During the visit a detailed training on AudioMoth configuration and programming was carried out to the Audubon Panama team. During the training the Audubon Panama team was able to successfully program and configure 16 AudioMoths to record one minute each five minutes using 48 kHz in sampling rate, and medium gain in the mic. The training also included the creation of a project in the <a href="https://arbimon.rfcx.org/project/panama-blue-natural">Arbimon Platform</a> and some tips to successfully deploy the recorders using the Android App RFCx Companion to synchronize the AudioMoth with the phone.</p>
<h2 id="backup-of-recordings-obtained-through-acoustic-monitoring-and-document-explaining-file-organization">Backup of recordings obtained through acoustic monitoring and document explaining file organization</h2>
<p>All the recordings are already in <a href="https://arbimon.rfcx.org/project/panama-blue-natural">Arbimon</a> and a copy is also being uploaded to the the AudubonÂ´s Box.</p>
<h3 id="naming-convention-for-sites">Naming convention for sites</h3>
<p>There are two bays Panama and Parita.</p>
<p>There are two samples for each bay. One in the migratory season (January-February) and another in the non-migratory season (June-July).</p>
<p>There are several sites per bay. Each site corresponds to a carbon transect, although there may be several recorders per transect.</p>
<p>To name the sites begin with the name of the bay, then the sample number, then the name of the site and finally the number of the recorder, separating it with an underscore.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parita_01_ElAgallito_06 corresponds to a sampling with recorder number 6 at the &ldquo;El Agallito&rdquo; site in the January-February season and in Parita Bay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parita_02_PenonHonda_02 corresponds to a sampling in the Parita bay in the June-July season at the site called &ldquo;PenonHonda&rdquo; with recorder number 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming-convention-for-wav-file-names">Naming convention for wav file names</h3>
<p>The audio files are in the .WAV format. The files follow the default AudioMoth naming system. The name starts with the date and is followed by the hour separated by and underline. For example the file 20230118_175500.WAV is a file recorded the year 2023, month 01, day 18 in the hour 17:55.
Each file is 5 minutes.</p>
